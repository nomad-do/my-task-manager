## Prerequisites

Before you begin setting up the My-Task-Manager application, ensure you have the following software installed on your system. These tools are necessary to run a MERN stack application and utilize all its features:

### 1. **Node.js**
- **Description**: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and it's necessary for running the server-side portion of your application.
- **Version Required**: Ensure you have Node.js version 14.x or higher installed, as this version provides better performance and enhanced security features.
- **Installation**: Download and install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. **MongoDB**
- **Description**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store your application's data. My-Task-Manager uses MongoDB to manage tasks, user settings, and other dynamic information.
- **Version Required**: MongoDB version 4.4 or higher is recommended.
- **Installation**: You can install MongoDB locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas. Instructions for both can be found on the [MongoDB official website](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### 3. **npm (Node Package Manager)**
- **Description**: npm is the package manager for Node.js and helps manage project dependencies.
- **Installation**: npm is installed automatically with Node.js, but you may want to ensure it's updated to the latest version by running `npm install npm@latest -g` in your terminal.

### 4. **React.js**
- **Description**: React.js is a front-end JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, specifically for single-page applications.
- **Installation**: React will be installed as part of your project dependencies via npm, but having a general understanding of its structure and capabilities is beneficial. More information can be found at [React official documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

### 5. **Git**
- **Description**: Git is a distributed version control system to manage your application's source code history.
- **Installation**: Download and install Git from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/). This will be crucial for version control and contribution if you are collaborating with others.

### 6. **A Text Editor or IDE**
- **Description**: A code editor is required to write and edit your code. IDEs like Visual Studio Code also provide additional tools and extensions specifically useful for MERN stack development.
- **Recommendations**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/) are popular choices that support JavaScript and have useful plugins for Node.js and React development.

### 7. **An Internet Connection**
- **Description**: An active internet connection is required to install necessary npm packages, access MongoDB Atlas if using a cloud database, and for various APIs that My-Task-Manager might interact with.

Each of these components plays a crucial role in the setup and execution of your Task Manager application. Make sure to install and configure each one according to the provided instructions before proceeding with the installation of My-Task-Manager.
